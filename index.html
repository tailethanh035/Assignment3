              <h6 id="Part1.1"> 1.1 Team name</h6>
              <p>Our team decided to name the group project “Group 23”. The main reason is that we want a 
                simple name and easy to remember. So, we chose to use “Group 23” just like the number of our 
                group on Canvas because it is simple, and it is where our group began from the start.</p>
              <h6 id="Part1.2">1.2 Personal Information</h6>
              <p> <b>Nguyen Tan Thinh </b> <br>
                My name is Nguyen Tan Thinh (s3927186), I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City 
                in Viet Nam. I have been a student with 12 years of outstanding academic performance, a 7.0 IELTS score,
                 and completion in math, chemistry, and computer science A-level courses. Besides my mother tongue, I can 
                 speak fluent English. As for hobbies, I really like PCs (personal computers), cars, motorcycles, and I 
                 especially have a lot of love for animals. I enjoyed coding because to me it is one of the most interesting 
                 aspects of computing. As mentioned, I have completed an A-level computer science course, so I have been coding
                  with Python for 2 years. <br> <br>
                  <b> Le Thanh Tai</b> <br>
                  I am Le Thanh Tai and I am a third-year student of RMIT University. My major is Software Engineering. I was born
                   in Da Nang and moved to Ho Chi Minh City when I was 2. I can use both Vietnamese and English. I can also use some 
                   of the programming languages like C, C++ and Java. I do have some hobbies and one of them is photography. Though I
                    am into photography and also have taken a class called Photography 101 from RMIT, my skill in taking photos is 
                    decent and needs more practicing. I also love pets, especially the ones with fur like cats and dogs. I do have a 
                    cat, which I adopted a year ago when I found it on the street. <br> <br>
                   <b>Doan Chanh Thong </b> <br>
                    My name is Doan Chanh Thong, and my student ID is s3852304. I am a Vietnamese who study in RMIT SGS, but currently in online mode. I am interested in basketball and the field of IT, especially Artificial Intelligence. I usually spend most of my time on the computer, searching for anything related to Technology. Recently, I have invested in cryptocurrency after hours of researching, following the news, and gaining knowledge from Fintech RMIT club and workshop. However, the profit has not come yet, but I have broadened my knowledge of this topic. I am never bored learning and doing things about IT. To be honest, I don't have much experience in IT area. After finishing high school, I started many projects with Python and C# after self-studying; however, it was a long time ago, and I did not obtain any specific achievement. But I am willing to learn and embrace the difficulties, and my weaknesses to improve further in the university environment and future career. My current skills are calculus and linear algebra, analytical skills, and knowledge and experience about C# and Python.
                    <br> <br>
                     <b>Cao Ngoc Son</b> <br>
                  My name is Cao Ngoc Son(s3916151) and I am a first-year student at RMIT SGS. I studied high school abroad at Western Reserve Academy, Ohio, USA for 3 years and started at RMIT this July. During my high schools days, I focused on learning computer science and coding-related course. Coming into this second semester, I have 2 years of Python experience, 1 year of Java under my belt, and basic understanding of HTML and CSS. I have also learned AP computer science, AP Statistics, and Calculus. I have been especially interested in developing software and looking forward to learning to become a fully fledge software developer. Aside from that, my hobbies include reading novels, comics and watching films.

              <h6 id="Part1.3">1.3 Group Processes</h6>
              <p>Overall, our group gets along quite well. Although we started Assignment 2 a little late, we soon caught up with it over the last two weeks and completed our handed parts well. Following that, we established certain ground rules for working on the group project. Every week, between Wednesday and Saturday, we will host a group meeting, either online or in person. During the meeting, we discuss what needs to be done, whether any group members require assistance, and assign responsibilities to each group member for the coming week. At the end of the week, each group member turns in the assignment for which they were responsible that week.
                Reflecting on our journey through this course, one improvement we could make is to devote more time to rehearse before the presentation day. The presentation is a highly essential event because it contains a large amount of our points in this course. Even though our group presentation goes well, we believe there is space for development. We would do at least two group rehearsals before the presentation day the next time.
                </p>
              <h6 id="Part1.4">1.4 Career Plan</h6>
              <p>In this section, we decided to re-use the parts from 1.4 Ideal Job in Assignment 2 and explained in more detailed about our career plans <br>
                After reading and comprehending each member's intended job and career plan, here is the comparison. In general, our professions are similar in terms of design, data handling, and problem-solving. However, each of our ideal jobs has unique characteristics that distinct us from one another. Thinh's work is to deal with Python software development duties as a Senior Python Developer; Tai's job is to create Java-based applications and software as a Java Developer; Thong's job is to design, administer, and maintain data systems and databases; and Son's job is to be a software developer that creates software systems to fulfil client's requirements. While Thong, Thinh, and Son tend to stay in their departments for as long as possible, Tai aspires to advance from Java Developer to university lecturer in the future.

             <br>
             <p>In the team project, Tai is the one that has experiences with Front-end coding and Web Development. Therefore, he will take full responsibilities in developing our team website.  As a matter of fact, he is the only one the develops the website, so the GitHub commit history only traces his commits. However, he has invited all the team members to access his GitHub repository so that the team members can check his new commit.  So by checking the commit history, all the team members can follow what Tai has done or what the new update he just made. Therefore, all the team members can give comments and recommendations to him to improve our team website.  We can say that though Tai is the only one that make commits to develop the website, the website can be built like this is because of the efforts of the whole team by using the GitHub log of activity. As a result, commit log of activity help us a lot in managing, tracking the progress of the project and we can conclude the fact that the one did the commits is not that important but the way we use the GitHub audit trail can improve our group work a lot. </p>

            <div class="textdiv">
              <h6 id="Part3.1">3.1 Overview </h6>
              <p>
                <b>3.1.1 Topic</b>  <br>
            -	Our project is a game that is based on a famous Japanese game and animation series called Pokémon. Even as big as the Pokémon franchise is, all their official games throughout from the start in 1996 till now don’t have multiplayer or heavily focused on single-player function, and we thought that Pokémon is most fun when played with others. So, we want to create a game that players can enjoy with their family, friends and people all around the world.
-	When this game is finished, we want to see everyone enjoy our product as a way to relieve stress after a day of work or school. And if this project becomes successful, we can build a small community that can support us for future projects. With a successful product can also help us to reach for larger companies to fund us too .
                <br> <br> <b> 3.1.2 Motivation </b> <br>
-	We started this project as we wanted to share our hobby for other people to enjoy and have a fun time playing the game. We also want to inspire the young generation to the fun, adventurous, and lovable part of Pokémon, it’s even better if it makes them want to create a game of their own too since being able to create their own game is many programmers' dream.
-	Even though this project does not fit in with current IT trends because this is a traditional style game, it is simple and easy that we can finish early on, and this can help us to gain more experience in making games. This can show future employers that rather than having big ideas, but we don’t know if it will be a success or not, we do have some experience and a working product to prove our skills, this can help interested the employers in the prospect of the future improvement of the game.
         <br> <br> <b>3.1.3 Landscape</b> <br>
-	Pokémon had existed for more than 2 decades now with a huge die-hard fan-base worldwide, so it would be a lie to say that we are the first one to ever introduce the multiplayer system to the series. There’re also have been some fan-made games that have this system such as Pokémon Showdown - a web-based 3D Pokémon battle game or Myuu - a Pokémon game that is an add on in Discord. 
-	To the Pokémon community, we don’t look at other fan-made Pokémon games as competitors but as a means to spread our passion to the community, more fan-made Pokémon games mean that we can enjoy this hobby of our more than before. Even though these Pokémon games are similar, each fan-made game will have its own unique characteristics. Instead of traditional player vs player in other games, our game provides an extra game mode that makes the game more challenging and exciting when facing another player.
              </p>
              <h6 id="Part3.2">3.2 Aim</h6>
              <p>
                The project's ultimate attention is to satisfy Pokémon' lovers for their passion for the well-known Pokémon game series. After the game is finished, it will create a small playground for like-minded people worldwide to enjoy the game. Not only can people play the game, but they also can connect with others and share their thoughts to help the community accumulate success. Besides, we will implement more features and functionality to make the game more interactive and gain investor attention soon.
The most important aspect of the project's success is to have a clear goal and a promising weekly plan so that everyone can participate and contribute a decent amount of work toward the project. Our final goal is to create a turn-based RPG game based on Pokémon, but it is a complicated quest. Narrowing our plan down to a specific task is a more feasible way, such as the first week to design the game, create the game function in the second week and complete everything in the preceding week. However, our project's limitations involve procrastination, technical issues, and personal issues like different working times. Despite this, with each member's commitment and determination, it is compelling that our product would complete successfully on time. We would spend time and work together, or even change our plan to be suitable before our deadline if there are still many uncertainties and difficulties occurring in the project.
              </p>
              <h6 id="Part3.3">3.3 Plan and Progress</h6>
              <p>
                 <b>The beginning: </b> <br>

This project started after our team's first meeting at Assignment 2, we had a discussion about which member’s project we wanted to do. Thinh’s project is about social media site that focused on exercise and training, Tai’s project is about an RPG game based on the Pokémon franchise, Thong project is about a program that can predict market stock price, unfortunately, Son wasn’t available at that time so we couldn’t discuss his project. After the meeting, we decided that we were going to use Tai’s project as the project for the whole group. However, we didn’t build this game from scratch, his project is actually a continuation from his previous project that he was planned to do. 

We chose this path for a few reasons. First of all, since this is a continuation of an already existing project, this can bring in many advantages for us. Compared to other projects like Thinh and Thong, which is a completely new idea, being a continuation project means that Tai had had some guidelines and how he wanted the project to be done so the planning will be much smoother than trying to plan a new one but don’t have any idea where to start. Plus, Tai is a third-year student at RMIT University, so he will have a lot more experience and he can guide newcomers like Thinh, Thong, and Son to avoid mistakes. Another reason is that his project is already started so we want to finish it first as soon as possible, this way Tai’s project can be done and other member projects can start when they become more experienced in their respective field. We felt like this is very reasonable planning, so we went with it. 

<br> <br> <b>Progression: </b>  <br>

We started with what is left from the last project, where the game had a set of rules that players need to know. The objective of this game is to defeat all monsters of the opponent. When we started, the game had has a basic format like the UI for the home screen, battle scene, and end scene. We do have models for 15 monsters that the game currently has and intend to expand the collection in the future update. Some basic features are also done such as the ability to pick 3 out of 15 monsters for the normal mode and randomize 3 of them for the random mode and so on. 

When we have started we did have some meetings through an online platform throughout the first week and the second week the group got together on what we should do next. With the amount of time we have, we predicted that not a lot can be done so after some time we came up with some planning for this project and hope we can work it in time. We divided the game into 4 separated sections: home page, monsters pick, battle scene, and end scene. Since we already have all the basic functions available, we all agreed on prioritizing things that can be quickly put together first like finalizing each section for the next two weeks: adding sound effects, music, animations, the transitions between sections. Unfortunately, we were right about the time so we did some meeting and decided to cut down on the transition part because we don’t have material for that part and we have to code for it which will take more time than the one we already don’t have enough. Plus, we also have some difficulties in creating and adding extra items to the main program and make space for the testing phases.  

To conclude where we are at the moment, we did design and add some more features for the game such as the extra items, animations, sound effects and music in the final week. With these new features so we also add a new UI for the items. For all this to happen, we arrange meetings throughout the weeks when there’s something to be fixed or need a big update. And right now, the game can run normally with the home page working well, the monster picks, and the end scene running smoothly, however, some minor bugs did appear in the battle scene making the game crash sometimes in testing. 

<br> <br> <b>Future plans:   </b>  <br>

The game is currently at about 80% finished, even though the game can run normally, but there are still many bugs that stayed in the game. With the times we have left, we are not sure if we can complete the game, we will put it in the future plans. The primary plan we want to focus on now is fixing all the bugs that appear in the game currently with some minor visual's bugs. When all of these bugs have been removed, we do have some extra features that we planned to add in the future.  

The first feature is the single-player mode, this game is made for people to enjoy battling Pokémon to each other, however not all the time that player always want to battle other people online but just enjoy their private time alone, so we still want to add this function to the game, this required AI (Artificial Intelligence) to learn about the move sets and how to use it on the player. And we thought about the difficulty for each level player selected. At easy, we will apply AI that has learned over 50 times, this AI will only cover the basic attack but don’t know how to use tactics such as using strong opposing element Pokémon to fight. At medium, AI learned over 100 times will be applied, the AI can use both basic attacks and tactics against the player, basically, it will act as another player. At hard, we will let AI learn for 300 games, at this level, AI can cover all the attacks, tactical Pokémon change, and effects that can post a challenge for the player. 

The second one is adding the sever that can handle more than 2 players which is currently the maximum number of players that can be played. When this mode is added, not just a one v one but four v four or odds like three v two, with this can create a lot of potential for the game like a tournament or ranking. This function is very important because if we can implement this system, it’s highly going to be the main attraction point of the game like many multiplayer games that have been blown up such as Crab game, Trackmania, Dead by Daylight, vice versa.

              <p>The precise duties for our group project are listed above. However, we all contribute to the game's coding and assist one another in carrying out our duties. </p>
              <h6 id="Part3.5">3.5 Scope and Limit</h6>
              <img src="files/table1.PNG" alt="Scope Table">
              <p>
                <b>Limitations:</b> <br>
Only two players can play with each other at a same time only
In order to play between more than two players, another application needs to be created as the Server to receive and handle the request and data of the user using the game. This application must be run in a powerful computer and running 24/24 for the multi-user purpose. The protocol for sending and parsing the data between the clients and server must be created to help the server handle the data from the clients. The server application and data protocol need 2-3 months to finish and the need of the powerful computer playing as the server is out of limit.
                <br> <br> <b>The number of monsters limited at 15</b>	<br>
By having 15 monsters in the game, the monster display view has mostly run out of space. If the number passes the number 15, a scrolling or more scenes will need to be made to display more monsters. Due to the fact that the feature is not that important while the project is limited in the next 12 weeks, the number for the monster will be limited at 15
	              <br> <br> <b> Damage calculation algorithm </b> <br>
At the moment, damage calculation algorithm of the application is mostly based on the 3 main data: Damage, HP and Defense. However, if the game extract from other data source like critical strike, poison, faction counter and so on, the algorithm will be changed completely and the new algorithm will need a great use of mathematics and probability. Due to the time and human resources limit, making new algorithm will need a deep learning in mathematics or recruiting professional in the field and will be out of limit

              <h6 id="Part3.7">3.7 Testing</h6>
              <p>
                We have numerous testing plans for our game that we will implement throughout the project. Each member will be assigned duties to fulfil each week. When a person completes a task (usually towards the end of the week), he tests it to see if the results are as predicted. We also have two key testing phases as a group: front-end design and game features. Because we begin with the front-end design before going on to the game features, we conduct a test inside our group once we have completed the front-end design and another once we have completed all the game features. Moreover, each game element is also tested individually each week before the entire game is tested.  Once we have decided that the game is now completed, we look for test participants outside of our group. Although anyone could be a test user, we prefer those who are familiar with previous RPG Pokémon games. This is because someone who has played the original game on which our project is based can give us better insight into what to improve in our game. Our target test participants are those we can contact for assistance, such as relatives and friends, because it is more convenient and less time-consuming to find test takers. Ideally, we would like to have as many test participants as possible, but 5-10 people should suffice.

              <h6 id="Part3.8">3.8 Timeframe</h6>
              <h6 id="Part3.9">3.9 Risks</h6>
              <p>
               <b>  The game crashing during running (Weak debugging)   </b> <br>
Due to the fact that the game using both front-end components and the internet connection, without proper use of try-catch exception, the game can be crashed at any time during being used. Firstly, the main thread that runs the UI cannot put in the same thread at the connection thread because that will cause the application to crash. In addition, the application uses multiple scenes so that if the developers have a little mistake in using the UI components from the other scenes, or the developers parse invalid data between scenes, the game will get error immediately
<br> <b>•	Mitigation:</b> Good use of try-catch condition can avoid the game to crash. However, the developers should get the Exception message in order to get the bug and deals with it correspondingly. Multithreading is a must because not only using multiple threads avoid the application to get crashed but it also helps the application runs faster. And lastly, good naming convention of the UI components like the ImageView, Button and so on can help the developers distinguish the components that they are using.
 <br> <br> <b> Misunderstanding connection message </b> <br>
As the application uses the Socket Protocol for the connection, the data sending between addresses can only be in String type. Therefore, the way that a client sends the message and the way it receives and decodes the message from another client is very important. If one of the client decoding one message wrong during the Battle Phase, the synchronization between clients will be broken and the game will cannot be played anymore. At a matter of fact, the current demo of the application meets this situation since the Potion using feature in the game cannot send the data to the opponent that the player just used the Potion to heal his Monster.
<br> <b>•	Mitigation:</b> Having a good syntax for the message between clients will fix it all. If one side sends the message with the syntax and the opponent has the function to decode the message correctly. The game will be synchronized all the time. Taking example of the browser when the user send signal to the server to search a page, the HTML protocol will send the message syntax the distinguish the URL, response code and so on.
 <br> <br> <b> Copyright Lawsuit </b> <br>
The project is based on the famous franchise which is the Pokémon and has used a lot of data from the series including sounds, images and the contents. Therefore, if the team does not deal with the copyright before release the game, they can be sued for violating the copyright.
<br> <b>•	Mitigation:</b>  The project team must choose the way they release the game. If the project is purely based on the interest, they can use the game without commercial purpose and will not violate the copyright. On the other hand, if they  want to place the game on the marker, they have to work with the owners of the Pokémon copyright for the permission first.

              <h6 id="Part3.10">3.10 Group Reflection and Communications</h6>
              <p>
                Since the beginning of Assignment 2, our group has set communication guidelines. To begin, we will hold weekly meetings for one hour each to keep track of progress and assigned work. Depending on the workload, each member of the group will spend at least an additional hour outside of class time to complete their work for the week. If we could do so under the circumstances of the pandemic, a face-to-face meeting would be the best option. If a face-to-face meeting was not possible, the team decided to arrange an online meeting through Messenger. Email and Facebook are our key modes of communication. Most of the time, we communicate via a group chat dedicated to our group work. The messages include but are not limited to, key news about our group project, requests for assistance with a specific portion of the project, group meeting times, and anything else relating to the group project. If a group member misses a piece of important news, a fully detailed communication email will be sent to each group member's school email account.
                Although this did not occur in our group, we had contingency plans in place in case a member did not reply to communications. If a member does not respond to the group via any communication means that group members have compromised earlier, we shall wait 5 days before requesting help from our lecturer to contact him via email. However, if it is related to work that must be completed before the deadline and our group has not heard from him or received his work, we will grant him until 1-3 days before the deadline (depending on the work difficulty). After that, we will conduct a meeting as a group to discuss sharing his tasks and mark it as not his work.

            <div class="textdiv">
              <p>
                In summary, our project is about developing a game based on the famous Pokémon series using Java language. Basically, there are not many tools required to develop this application and the tools only support the wireframe design and Java coding. Therefore, our team decided the 4 jobs that we will employ to work with the project and arranged in priority order: 

<br> <b>Front end developer </b> <br>

Description: Most of the team members of the project are first year students so we are not experienced with Front-end coding because those are only in the advanced courses for the third and fourth year. As a matter of fact, the most viral role in developing a game is the one that does the Front-end coding, so we placed the Front-end Developer position as the first place. The one takes this position will also work as the Team Leader to lead the original members of the team project developing the game  

<br>Skills: Our team decided that the game will be in Java Language and using JavaFX to build the User Interfaces so the Front-end Developer will need to be experienced with Object-Oriented Programming and JavaFX library. He will also work as the Team Leader so the leadership skill is compulsory 

<br>Experience: He will lead couple of inexperienced developers so the Front-end Developer must have at least 2 or 3 projects working as the Project Manager. Front-end Developers can be divided into different types and the project is about developing a game so the developer need to be in 4 or 5 projects in developing a game before.  

<br> <br> <b>Designer</b>  

<br>Description: While the Front-end Developer is in charge of the functionalities of the application, the Designer will make sure that the game will look good, or the UI components can be handled well or not. The game will be meaningless if it cannot run but if it can run well but the UI is poor and the interacting between the users and interface is not suitable, the game will be ruined as well. Therefore, we place the priory of the Designer right below the Front-end Developer not only because it is the vital position but actually no one in the team is good with designing.  

<br>Skills: Knowledge of the Pokémon franchise. Experienced in designing the game characters and backgrounds. Decent designing skill is important. 3D Design is optional 

<br>Experience: The designer at least has some experiences with any platform of the Pokemon series like game or cartoon. Have at least 2 years of experience and be at least in 1 project relevant to game design 

<br> <br> <b>Java developer </b> <br>

Description: For many games, Java usually acts as a core language for coding so it is important to have a Java developer when making a game. A Java developer will have the responsibility of coding and making everything in the game work in Java language this includes: designing and implementing Java applications, developing and testing the game, finally resolving a technical problem that arises. 

<br>Skills: Able to work with JavaServer pages, Web frameworks, Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, vice versa. 

<br>Experience: Expertise in Java coding language for 2 years 

<br><br> <b>Marketer </b> <br>

Description: In order to sell a product, the first thing we need to do is advertise the product to the market, and that is the duty of a marketer. A marketer is going to promote products, in this case, the game on behalf of the company and in this case Group 23. A marketer will engage with their audiences in many forms for example online, events inside or outside of the company’s location. 

<br>Skills: Expertise in communication skills with good time management and analytical skills 

<br>Experience: know how to research on a subject in order to know which and when is the right time to sold the product

After working together with the group, I do have some experience I want to share. First of all, is what went well in the group. Overall, the group works surprisingly well together at a very fast pace, I think this is because we have Tai as a member of the group, he is a third-year so he has lots of experience and with a lot of help from Son and Thong. In the end, I think our program is very good since we did actually make it become a normal working real game, not just ideas and pictures. However, we did have some problems during this assignment, when there are so many deadlines from other courses, it’s hard to stay in contact with everyone, so I think this could be improved by often checking the group email. It was no surprise that just working with each other for 2 weeks is not enough for us to actively communicate with each other, however when we start to get together and distribute the workload, we worked surprisingly tight together at a fast pace is very surprising to me. After all this time working under group 23, I have learned something and one of those things is how important it is to be able to work fast because if there’s issue arise, I can counter it easily and how I should regularly update the group my progress. 

<br> <b> Doan Chanh Thong </b>  <br>

Working with the team up to the current stage, I feel grateful and fortunate to be a part of this collective. At the beginning stage, we were reluctant and felt strange to talk. It has been a long time since everyone worked online switched to offline; however, the awkwardness disappeared when we communicated and initiated the assignment. Everyone is open-hearted, respectfully listens to others' ideas, and tries their best to complete the assigned task. For instance, Thinh always reminds the team to stay focused, Son enthusiastically supports and gives advice on team members' ideas, and Tai frequently questions to ensure everything is up-to-date and precise. Though I had personal issues to solve and prolonged our submission plan, the team and I constantly asked what others had done to ensure everyone benefited and solved any uprising problems. I have gained experience in writing skills as well as communication skills for this report. In the meantime, we manage to complete the assignment and have spare time to fix any new obstacles before the deadline. 

<br> <b> Cao Ngoc Son </b>  <br>

The group project was a success in general. Even though our group had some communication issues at the start of the project and that our presentation may be improved, the project turned out as intended. We had no technical challenges while working on the game for a few weeks because everyone has a background in computer science and programming. In truth, it was surprising how smoothly everything went, especially during the few weeks spent working on the most difficult portion, the game features. At first, I assumed that finishing all of the game features would take at least three weeks, if not more, yet we finished them in the time allotted. I'm also thrilled to learn that the other members of the group are quite creative and talented. Throughout the project, none of us asked for assistance with the tasks assigned to him, and we all accomplished them on time. We also had several great ideas during group meetings but were unable to implement all of them owing to time constraints. 

<br> <br> <b> Le Thanh Tai  </b>  <br>

In this project, I have been though a lot of challenges and also gained great achievements. Especially, the greatest thing that our team has achieved is that our team has succeeded to convert our design into an actual application. Though the demo of our project got couple of bugs, it still can function well and we were so proud when we present our application in the presentation before the whole class. However, we cannot run the actual code of our design and instead of that, we only play recordings of our application because we forget to store the project in our devices and that what we need to improve in the next time which we should have good preparation. The thing that surprised me most during the past weeks is that though we only started to do the assignment few days before the deadlines, we can still make it. Though that is not a thing to be proud of, but it makes me realize one thing, good teamwork and communication can help we work better and more efficient. 

<br> <br> <b>5.2 Group’s perception </b> <br>

We all face the same challenges as a group, but we all agree that the group project was a success. As noted in the individual reflection above, our group faces some communication challenges at first because we are not yet accustomed to each other. In reality, aside from our weekly meetings in weeks 8-9 and 12, we hardly saw each other offline. However, because all group members had prior experience with online learning and online meetings, the group rapidly caught up to pace and everything was in order. Even more surprising, our group completes their assigned tasks at a rapid and efficient rate. For example, we only spent three days looking for an interviewee for the IT work section of assignment 2(and finishing it), which is regarded as the most difficult part. Not only that, but we completed all of the assigned tasks on time, including the game features, which took us less than two weeks to accomplish. This is not to say that our group is without flaws. Despite the fact that we accomplish the task quickly, we do not distribute the work evenly across every day of the five weeks (weeks 8-12) that we were allocated for this project. Although every member of the group completes their work on time, we occasionally leave it too close to the deadline and have to rush the work. A better time allocation within the group can assist members accomplish their job faster and have adequate time to check and improve their work before the deadline. 

 <br> One thing we've discovered about our group is that we all enjoy Pokemon, games, and are incredibly creative. During the first two sessions, everyone agreed almost immediately on doing the Pokemon game as the group project. Not only that, but we all contributed some extremely fascinating ideas, such as blitz mode, extra Pokemon attributes, items, and so on. Unfortunately, due to time and skill constraints, we were unable to satisfy all ideas. 

<br> Each of us was allocated roles and tasks to accomplish throughout our time working on the project. In our Git repository, we have included a "All Meeting Minute" pdf file that shows the weekly meeting time, tasks to be completed, and deadlines for such tasks. Although our group had separate responsibilities and roles, we also assisted one another in performing specific chores, therefore the meeting minute pdf file will show every member doing a task.
